Arena Respawn Gamemode Design (This overview highlights the changes made to Arena mode):

- First Blood crits are disabled.
- Each round starts with 1 minute and 20 seconds timer. If neither team captures the point within that time, the round results in a stalemate.
- After 15 seconds from the round start, the capture point unlocks.
- The capture rate for the point is 2 seconds. 
- When a player captures the point, their teammates respawn, and timer is set to 1 minute and 20 seconds.
- When a player is on a captured point that belong to their team, they'll be marked for death. The debuff expires within 5 seconds when leaving the captured point.
  
Why Add These Changes (These changes prioritizes toward causal players):
- First Blood crits was too punishing.
- As round starts with a 1 minute and 20 second timer, making players move quickly to fight.
- Players dislike waiting to respawn for long period of time and so, 15 seconds from round start for the capture point to unlock should resolve that.
- Fast capture rate means less risk, high reward to help teammates respawn.
- Letting players respawn on a captured point doesn't make them stare at the spectator screen.
- Marked for death debuff on a captured point that belong to to their team prevents difficulty for the opposing team capper.
